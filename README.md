## UX Demos by Dev

Going to list off a few different designs I'm thinking of when it comes to managing different streams on one home-page. 

### Goals

The website needs to accomplish two goals: 
 - show new streamers what they don't know they need to know
 - connect new streamers to each other

I chose these two goals because they directly translate to quantifiable features on the main user interface, and because they align with the project mission. 

*Story Time*
My friends are like me, people who play video games socially and because we're a little competetive, so we don't really watch streamers. To us, video games are a hobby and social event, something we can build a little extra social time into while feeling like we're getting better at something. To younger generations (and us when we were younger) games were the _core_ of that social interaction, not just the thing we used as an excuse to hang out.

Streamers on Twitch fill a bit of that gap for younger generations. Kids these days are finding social interaction online _primarily_, while gaming can take a back seat. They can be competetive in other ways, they just need something to talk about and fill blank space with. Streamers are big personalities that everyone knows about, it's a microcosm of "regular" non-online traditional celebrity.

Obviously, it's more complex than this in real life, but I use this simpler framework of online interaction in the younger generation as context for INT.TV. The app is meant to run alongside these ideas -- of social interaction and competition -- by placing them next to each other, rather than on opposite ends of a spectrum. The goal is to get the shared interest that a group of people have and use it as a snare to get them in the same chat room. It's supposed to be authentic because it doesn't catch people who aren't in that scene.

So I have these two goals I'm working with: show them the competition in its most brutal, and let them face it together.

How can I make Twitch seem like a game, like a mission in a large RPG?
